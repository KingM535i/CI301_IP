Project Scope (taken from CI301 Interim Investigation & Planning Report - 21 Nov 2018)

The purpose of the project is to investigate the possibility and practicality of using a computer to uniquely identify an object from a visual data source using a computationally efficient and deterministic program, and explicitly not a machine learning algorithm or process.
The requirements and areas of investigation for this project need be related to the subject of computer science. This project is particularly focussed on the areas of computer vision, efficient processing, and deterministic programs.
By the end of the project I hope to have produced a computationally efficient program with high determinism, which can uniquely identify objects consistently.
